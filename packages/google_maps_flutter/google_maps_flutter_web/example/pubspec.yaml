# Tests require flutter beta or greater to run.
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
  flutter: ">=2.0.0" 
  # Actually, Flutter 2.0.0 shipped with a slightly older version of integration_test that
  # did *not* support null safety. This flutter constraint should be changed to >=2.1.0 when
  # that version (or greater) is shipped to the `stable` channel.
  # This causes integration tests to *not* work in `stable`, for now. Please, run integration tests
  # in `beta` or newer (flutter/plugins runs these tests in `master`).
