# This exists to add a lint for missing API docs just on this specific package,
# since not all packages have coverage for all their public members yet and
# adding it in would be non-trivial. `public_member_api_docs` should be applied
# to new packages going forward, and ideally the main `analysis_options.yaml`
# file as soon as possible.
