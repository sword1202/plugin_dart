## 0.1.0

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

## 0.0.2

* Added missing flutter_test package dependency.
* Added missing flutter version requirements.

## 0.0.1

* Initial release.
