# firebase_crashlytics_example

Demonstrates how to use the firebase_crashlytics plugin.

## Getting Started

### Add your own Firebase project

This example initially uses a default project for CI purposes. You must
replace the default project with your own so that you can review the error
reports submitted to the Firebase console.

See [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) for how to add
Firebase to a Flutter project.

For further help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](http://flutter.io/).
