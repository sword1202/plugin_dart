/// or verify the data using your own server with [serverVerificationData].
///
/// For details on how to verify your purchase on iOS,
/// you can refer to Apple's document about [`About Receipt Validation`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH105-SW1).

/// On Android, all purchase information should also be verified manually. See [`Verify a purchase`](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_library_overview#Verify).

/// Call [InAppPurchaseConnection.refreshPurchaseVerificationData] to get a new [PurchaseVerificationData] object. And then you can
