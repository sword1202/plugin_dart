# In App Purchase

A Flutter plugin for in-app purchases.

## Getting Started

This plugin is not ready to be used yet. Follow
[flutter/flutter#9591](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9591) for more
updates.

There's a significant amount of setup required for testing in app purchases
successfully, including registering new app IDs and store entries to use for
testing in both the Play Developer Console and App Store Connect. Both Google
Play and the App Store require developers to configure an app with in-app items
for purchase to call their in-app-purchase APIs. You can check out the [example
app](example/README.md) for an example on configuring both.

## Development

This plugin uses
[json_serializable](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/json_serializable) for the
many data structs passed between the underlying platform layers and Dart. After
editing any of the serialized data structs, rebuild the serializers by running
`flutter packages pub run build_runner build`. `flutter packages pub run
build_runner watch` will watch the filesystem for changes.

### Design

The API surface is stacked into 2 main layers.

1. [in_app_purchase_connection.dart](lib/src/in_app_purchase_connection.dart),
   the generic idiommatic Flutter API. This exposes the most basic IAP-related
   functionality. The goal is that Flutter apps should be able to use this API
   surface on its own for the vast majority of cases.
   [google_play_connection.dart](lib/src/google_play_connection.dart) and
   [app_store_connection.dart](lib/src/app_store_connection.dart) implement this
   for the specific platforms.

2. The dart wrappers around the platform specific IAP APIs and their platform
   specific implementations of the generic interface. See
   [store_kit_wrappers.dart](lib/src/store_kit_wrappers.dart) and
   [billing_client_wrappers.dart](lib/src/billing_client_wrappers.dart). These
   API surfaces should expose all the platform-specific behavior and allow for
   more fine-tuned control when needed.
