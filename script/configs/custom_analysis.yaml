# Plugins that deliberately use their own analysis_options.yaml.
#
# This only exists to allow incrementally switching to the newer, stricter
# analysis_options.yaml based on flutter/flutter, rather than the original
# rules based on pedantic (now at analysis_options_legacy.yaml).
#
# DO NOT add new entries to the list, unless it is to push the legacy rules
# from a top-level package into more specific packages in order to incrementally
# migrate a federated plugin.
#
# DO NOT move or delete this file without updating
# https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/tools/bots/flutter/analyze_flutter_plugins.sh
# which references this file from source, but out-of-repo.
# Contact stuartmorgan or devoncarew for assistance if necessary.

# TODO(ecosystem): Remove everything from this list. See:
# https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/76229
